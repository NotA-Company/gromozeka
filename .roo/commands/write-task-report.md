description: "Write task report, using proper template"
---

 Create a task report using the template at `docs/templates/task-report-template.md`
 This should be saved in Markdown file `docs/reports/` directory with naming pattern `task-[X.Y.Z]-TASK_BRIEF_DESCRIPTION-report.md`
 Report must include all sections from template with actual project-specific information, no placeholder text
