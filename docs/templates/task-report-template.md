## Template Usage Notes

[Do not add this section to report, it is used for informations purposes only]

**Instructions for using this template:**

1. **Replace all placeholder text** in brackets [like this] with actual content
2. **Update task numbering** (X.Y.Z) to match your project's task hierarchy
3. **Complete all sections** - do not leave any section empty or with placeholder text
4. **Use consistent formatting** - maintain checkbox format and link structure
5. **Validate file links** - ensure all linked files exist and are accessible
6. **Update commit references** - verify all commit hashes are correct and accessible
7. **Follow commit message format** - use the standardized conventional commit format

**Status Indicators:**
- ✅ = Completed successfully
- ⚠️ = Completed with issues or partially completed
- ❌ = Not completed or failed
- 🔄 = In progress (should not appear in final report)

**Commit Message Integration:**
- Use the summary section content for commit subject lines
- Include task reference in all commit footers
- Follow conventional commit format for automated tool integration
- Ensure commit messages are suitable for changelog generation

**Quality Standards:**
- All deliverables must be linked and accessible
- All commits must be properly referenced with valid hashes
- All testing must be documented with clear results
- All file changes must be categorized and explained
- Summary must be suitable for commit messages and stakeholder communication

**Automated Tool Integration:**
- Commit messages should follow conventional format for automated changelog generation
- File change categorization enables automated impact analysis
- Traceability matrix supports automated requirement tracking
- Quality metrics enable automated quality reporting

**Best Practices:**
- Write summary section first - it drives the rest of the report
- Document decisions and rationale for future reference
- Include enough detail for someone else to understand the implementation
- Link all files and commits for easy navigation
- Update project documentation and knowledge base as needed
