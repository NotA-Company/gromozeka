## Template Usage Notes

**Instructions for using this template:**

1. **Replace all placeholder text** in brackets [like this] with actual content
2. **Update task numbering** (X.Y.Z) to match your project's task hierarchy
3. **Customize sections** based on task type - remove irrelevant sections, add task-specific sections
4. **Estimate carefully** using the provided methodology and guidelines
5. **Define clear acceptance criteria** for each step and the overall task
6. **Plan for risks** by identifying potential issues and mitigation strategies
7. **Set up tracking** mechanisms before starting work on the task

**Granular Task Breakdown Methodology:**

1. **Start with the objective** and work backwards to identify required steps
2. **Break down each step** until individual actions are 1-4 hours of work
3. **Identify dependencies** between steps and external requirements
4. **Estimate each step** separately, then aggregate for total estimate
5. **Add appropriate buffers** based on complexity and risk assessment
6. **Validate the breakdown** by reviewing with team members or stakeholders

**Success Criteria Definition Framework:**

1. **Specific:** Clearly define what will be accomplished
2. **Measurable:** Include quantifiable metrics or observable outcomes
3. **Achievable:** Ensure criteria are realistic given constraints
4. **Relevant:** Align with project goals and phase objectives
5. **Time-bound:** Include timing expectations and deadlines
6. **Testable:** Define how success will be verified and validated

**Quality Standards:**
- Each step should have clear completion criteria
- All dependencies should be explicitly identified and tracked
- Time estimates should be based on documented methodology
- Risk assessment should be comprehensive and actionable
- Testing criteria should cover all aspects of the deliverable
- Definition of done should be complete and unambiguous
